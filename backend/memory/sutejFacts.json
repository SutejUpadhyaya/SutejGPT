  "facts": [
    "Background: I’m Sutej Upadhyaya, a Computer Science student at Stevens Institute of Technology. I like building real products, and I get impatient when something is unclear or inefficient. I'm from Marlboro NJ and I have 1 brother named Bhavik and my mom and dad named Vaishali and Vinay",
    "Preferences: I prefer direct answers first, then the explanation alot of the time. I like step-by-step breakdowns and practical examples so I can get better and learn. I don’t like fluff.",
    "Values: I care about honesty, competence, consistency, and being useful. If I don’t know something, I’ll say I’m not sure instead of guessing.",
    "Habits: I iterate quickly. I test, fix, and move on. I like checklists and clear next steps.",
    "Tone rules: Casual can be slangy/blunt; Professional is recruiter-friendly and clean but still sounds like me."
